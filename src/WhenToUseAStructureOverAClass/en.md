# When to Use a Structure Over a Class in C++

In C++, the technical difference between a `struct` and a `class` is minimal: the only distinction is that `struct` members are **public** by default, while `class` members are **private** by default. However, the decision to use a `struct` over a `class` often comes down to **convention**, **intent**, and **code readability**. Below is a summary of when to prefer a `struct` over a `class`, based on insights from Stack Overflow and related conventions.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c)

## Guidelines for Using `struct` Over `class`

1. **Simple Data Aggregation (Plain Old Data - POD)**:
   - Use a `struct` when you need a simple container for grouping related data without complex behavior or encapsulation.
   - Example: Representing a point in 3D space.
     ```cpp
     struct Point3D {
         float x, y, z;
     };
     ```
   - **Reason**: `struct` conveys that the type is primarily a "data bundle" with public members, making it clear to readers that the focus is on data, not behavior.[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/03/02/choose-struct-class/)

2. **C Compatibility or Legacy Code**:
   - Use `struct` when interfacing with C code or libraries, as C only supports `struct` for data types without methods or access control.
   - **Reason**: Ensures compatibility with C-style code, where `struct` is traditionally used for data structures.[](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/113321/why-are-struct-and-class-essentially-the-same-in-c)

3. **No Invariants or Minimal Encapsulation**:
   - Choose `struct` when the data members can vary independently and do not require invariants (conditions that must always hold true).
   - Example: A configuration struct where fields are set independently.
     ```cpp
     struct Config {
         int port;
         string hostname;
     };
     ```
   - **Reason**: Unlike `class`, which is often used to enforce invariants through private members and methods, `struct` signals that no such constraints exist.[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/03/02/choose-struct-class/)[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/06/13/the-real-difference-between-struct-class/)

4. **Code Readability and Convention**:
   - Use `struct` to align with conventions where other developers expect simple, transparent data structures.
   - Example: In libraries or teams where `struct` is used for public data and `class` for encapsulated objects.
   - **Reason**: It communicates intent clearly, making the codebase easier to understand for others.[](https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/28083/)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/92859/what-are-the-differences-between-struct-and-class-in-c)

5. **Performance in Small, Value-Type Objects**:
   - Prefer `struct` for small, immutable data types that are often copied or used as value types (e.g., in game programming for vertices).
   - Example: A vertex in a 3D model.
     ```cpp
     struct Vertex {
         float x, y, z;
         float u, v; // Texture coordinates
     };
     ```
   - **Reason**: `struct` is conventionally used for lightweight data types with minimal overhead, especially in performance-critical applications.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1815fs2/when_would_a_data_structure_be_used_in_a_class_vs/)

## When to Use `class` Instead
- Use a `class` when:
  - You need **encapsulation** (private members with getters/setters).
  - The type has **invariants** that must be maintained.
  - The type models a complex **abstraction** with behavior (e.g., methods, virtual functions).
  - You are implementing **object-oriented programming** features like inheritance or polymorphism.[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/03/02/choose-struct-class/)[](https://www.educative.io/answers/when-to-use-a-class-and-a-struct-in-cpp)

## Key Considerations
- **No Functional Difference**: Both `struct` and `class` can have member functions, constructors, destructors, and inheritance. The choice is stylistic, not functional.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/92859/what-are-the-differences-between-struct-and-class-in-c)
- **C++ Core Guidelines**:
  - Use `struct` for organizing related data without invariants.
  - Use `class` if the type has invariants or non-public members.[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/03/02/choose-struct-class/)[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/06/13/the-real-difference-between-struct-class/)
- **Historical Context**: `struct` exists in C++ for backward compatibility with C, but its role has evolved to support full class-like functionality. The choice often reflects programmer intent rather than technical necessity.[](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/113321/why-are-struct-and-class-essentially-the-same-in-c)

## Example Scenarios
- **Use `struct`**:
  ```cpp
  struct Employee {
      string name;
      int id;
      double salary;
  };
  ```
  - Suitable for simple data grouping with public access, no complex logic.
- **Use `class`**:
  ```cpp
  class BankAccount {
  private:
      double balance;
  public:
      void deposit(double amount);
      double getBalance() const;
  };
  ```
  - Suitable for encapsulating data and behavior with invariants (e.g., balance cannot be negative).

## Conclusion
Choose `struct` when you want to emphasize a simple, transparent data structure with public members and no complex behavior or invariants. Use `class` for types requiring encapsulation, invariants, or object-oriented features. The decision is primarily about **conveying intent** to other developers and adhering to established conventions for clarity and maintainability.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c)[](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/03/02/choose-struct-class/)[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/92859/what-are-the-differences-between-struct-and-class-in-c)
